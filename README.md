# Santa Beard Filter

JAVA | Processing | Face Detection | Filter

In the digital world of today, camera filters and applications have become pretty common. It has evolved over the years and has tapped the basic human emotion of augmenting their physical appearance to draw attention in social media. Top social media like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat to name a few, has been working on their filters tirelessly to enhance the user experience. These filters have become an integral part of our culture. 

When users look at these filters, they are usually drawn to the way that it makes them look like a more likable version of themselves. Some of the filters in social media also tend to use negative emotion in a positive way. The current project aims to exploit this basic human emotion of looking better in social media using face detection algorithm. 

## Chosen Input Data Source
The chosen input data source is a webcam where the image is continuously monitored using the OpenCV face detection library. 

## Chosen Visual Output
The chosen visual output is a simple image of the Santa's beard which is drawn at an optimal location once any human face is detected. 

## Design Rationale
The design rationale was to quickly prototype a camera application in Processing that will help the users to apply a Santa beard filter that can be used across any social media.
